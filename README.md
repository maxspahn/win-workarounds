# Windows Hacks

This repository holds information on how to get around working with windows when you are actually in love with UNIX, or
you interested in coding and feeling like hacking, or you simply never want to leave the terminal.

## WSL2

Obviously the easist way is to simply use WSL2. If set-up correctly, it allows you to feel like working on UNIX (most
distros are actually enable by default) without the overhead of a virtual machine. Some tricks are required to 
visualize GUI's and the network. However, it is generally hard to get access to all the devices connected to your 
machine. That can be very problamitic when trying to get cameras or robots in general to work.
More on that in [WSL-README](.wsl/README.md).
